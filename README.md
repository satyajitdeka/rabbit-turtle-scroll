# rabbit-turtle-scroll
The whole point is you can scroll and scroll and never reach the bottom of the page.  When you scroll you should travel 50% down the page, the next "scroll" should move you 50% closer to the bottom.  This way you will never reach the bottom, you will only get 50% closer each time.
